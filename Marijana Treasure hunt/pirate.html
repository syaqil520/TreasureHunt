        <h1>On the trail of Blackbeard</h1>

        <p>Blackbeard, was one of history’s most famous pirates
        He was born Edward Teach (Thatch or Thack) -though we'll never be sure of his real name as it was pirate custom at the time was to use a pseudonym when engaging in acts 
        of piracy, circa 1680 in England & died in 1718 in US. 
        Little we know of Blackbeard’s early life, and his origins have been left to speculation.  He seemed to have been active as a privateer for the British during the War of the 
        Spanish Succession (1701–13) before engaging in the profession he is most famous for.  
        
        Blackbeard was first heard of as a pirate late in 1716 and soon became notorious
        for outrages along the Virginia and Carolina coasts and 
        in the Caribbean Sea. 


        Apart from the luxuriant black beard which earned him his nickname, the most prominent aspect of the Blackbeard legend is his great buried 
        treasure, which has never been found and probably never existed.

        BLA BLA Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the word in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular during the Renaissance. The first line of Lorem Ipsum, "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..", comes from a line in section 1.10.32.

        The standard chunk of Lorem Ipsum used since the 1500s is reproduced below for those interested. Sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 from "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" by Cicero are also reproduced in their exact original form, accompanied by English versions from the 1914 translation by H. Rackham.
